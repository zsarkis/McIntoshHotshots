## üöÄ Deployment

### Fly.io Deployment

The application is configured for deployment to Fly.io with the app name `mcintoshhotshots-dev`.

#### Prerequisites
- Install the [Fly CLI](https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/install-flyctl/)
- Authenticate with Fly.io: `fly auth login`
- Ensure you have access to the `mcintoshhotshots-dev` app

#### Setting Up Secrets

To configure sensitive values like database connections and API keys, use Fly.io's secrets system. These values are injected into your app as environment variables and are **not stored in your codebase**.

Run the following commands from your terminal, replacing the values as needed:

```bash
# Database connection string for PostgreSQL
fly secrets set DATABASE_URL='Host=YOUR_HOST;Database=YOUR_DB;Username=YOUR_USER;Password=YOUR_PASSWORD' --app mcintoshhotshots-dev

# OpenAI API configuration for coaching features
fly secrets set OPENAI__APIKEY='your_openai_api_key' --app mcintoshhotshots-dev
fly secrets set OPENAI__ENDPOINT='https://api.openai.com/v1/responses' --app mcintoshhotshots-dev
fly secrets set OPENAI__MODEL='gpt-4o' --app mcintoshhotshots-dev
```

**Note**: The double underscores (`__`) in `OPENAI__APIKEY` map to colons (`:`) in the .NET configuration system. So `OPENAI__APIKEY` becomes accessible as `OpenAI:ApiKey` in your app.

#### Required Secret Values

| Secret | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string for your Fly.io database | `Host=your-db.internal;Database=mcintoshhotshots;Username=postgres;Password=your_password` |
| `OPENAI__APIKEY` | Your OpenAI API key for coaching features | `sk-...` |
| `OPENAI__ENDPOINT` | OpenAI API endpoint URL | `https://api.openai.com/v1/responses` |
| `OPENAI__MODEL` | OpenAI model to use for coaching | `gpt-4o` |

#### Deploying the Application

After updating secrets, you must redeploy the app so the new values are picked up:

```bash
fly deploy --app mcintoshhotshots-dev
```

This rebuilds and restarts the app with the updated secrets.

#### Deployment Pipeline Features
- Automated Docker builds
- Database migrations
- Environment-specific configurations
- Health checks and monitoring

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

- Mobile app for iOS and Android
- Advanced tournament formats (round-robin, Swiss system)
- Video replay integration
- Enhanced AI coaching with computer vision
- Social features and community engagement
- Integration with additional dart scoring platforms
