# Research Phase: Advanced Stat Viewing System

## Chart.js Integration with Blazor Server

### Decision
Use Chart.js via JavaScript interop in Blazor Server for all time series and statistical visualizations.

### Rationale
- **Performance**: Chart.js provides native JavaScript performance for complex time series rendering
- **Features**: Built-in zoom, pan, and interactive features required by FR-008
- **Community**: Extensive community support and documentation for statistical chart types
- **Integration**: Well-established patterns for Blazor JavaScript interop
- **Customization**: Full control over chart appearance to maintain UI consistency (FR-005)

### Alternatives Considered
- **Syncfusion Blazor Charts**: Rejected due to licensing costs and limited customization for statistical views
- **Native SVG/Canvas**: Rejected due to development complexity and performance concerns for large datasets
- **PlotlyJS**: Rejected due to larger bundle size and unnecessary complexity for our use case

### Implementation Approach
```javascript
// JavaScript interop pattern for chart updates
window.chartInterop = {
    createTimeSeriesChart: (canvasId, data, options) => {
        // Chart.js implementation
    },
    updateChartData: (chartId, newData) => {
        // Real-time data updates
    }
};
```

## PostgreSQL Time Series Aggregation

### Decision
Use PostgreSQL window functions and Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for time series data aggregation.

### Rationale
- **Performance**: Database-level aggregation is significantly faster than application-level calculations
- **Statistical Functions**: PostgreSQL provides built-in percentile, average, and median functions
- **Time Series Support**: Native date/time functions for weekly/monthly/quarterly/yearly grouping
- **Scalability**: Can handle large datasets (50k+ player records) efficiently

### Alternatives Considered
- **Application-level aggregation**: Rejected due to performance concerns and memory usage
- **Redis caching layer**: Rejected as premature optimization, adds complexity without clear benefit
- **Time series database (InfluxDB)**: Rejected due to infrastructure complexity and learning curve

### Query Patterns
```sql
-- Time series aggregation example
WITH weekly_stats AS (
    SELECT
        player_id,
        DATE_TRUNC('week', game_date) as week,
        AVG(score) as avg_score,
        PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY score) as median_score
    FROM player_statistics
    WHERE player_id = @playerId
    GROUP BY player_id, DATE_TRUNC('week', game_date)
)
SELECT * FROM weekly_stats ORDER BY week;
```

## Blazor Server Performance Optimization

### Decision
Use Blazor Server with optimized JavaScript interop for chart rendering and minimal SignalR overhead.

### Rationale
- **Infrastructure**: Leverages existing Blazor Server setup
- **Data Proximity**: Statistical calculations happen server-side near the database
- **State Management**: Simpler state management for complex statistical views
- **Security**: Sensitive statistical data stays server-side

### Alternatives Considered
- **Blazor WebAssembly**: Rejected due to larger initial payload and client-side data processing concerns
- **SignalR for real-time updates**: Rejected as unnecessary for statistical data that doesn't require real-time updates

### Performance Patterns
- Lazy loading for large datasets
- Chart data virtualization for time series with many points
- Debounced user interactions for filter changes
- Caching of aggregated statistics at service layer

## Head-to-Head Comparison Algorithms

### Decision
Implement server-side comparison algorithms with configurable metrics and tournament type filtering.

### Rationale
- **Accuracy**: Complex statistical calculations performed server-side for consistency
- **Flexibility**: Easy to add new comparison metrics without client updates
- **Performance**: Database-optimized queries for head-to-head matching

### Comparison Metrics
- Win/Loss ratio by tournament type
- Average score differential trends
- Recent form analysis (last 10 games)
- Tournament-specific performance patterns
- Statistical significance testing for small sample sizes

## UI Consistency and Component Architecture

### Decision
Create reusable Blazor components that extend existing UI patterns with Chart.js integration.

### Rationale
- **Consistency**: Maintains existing Bootstrap-based UI framework
- **Reusability**: Statistical components can be used across player and tournament views
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation between data logic and presentation

### Component Hierarchy
```
StatisticalView (Base)
├── TimeSeriesChart
├── MetricToggleComponent
├── DateRangeSelector
└── DataExportComponent

PlayerStatsView : StatisticalView
TournamentStatsView : StatisticalView
HeadToHeadView : StatisticalView
```

## Error Handling and Data Validation

### Decision
Implement graceful degradation for insufficient data scenarios with informative user messaging.

### Rationale
- **User Experience**: Clear feedback when statistical significance is low
- **Data Quality**: Validation ensures meaningful statistical displays
- **Robustness**: System continues to function with partial data

### Validation Rules
- Minimum 3 data points for time series display (FR-010)
- Statistical significance warnings for small sample sizes
- Graceful handling of missing tournament data
- Clear messaging for players with no head-to-head history
