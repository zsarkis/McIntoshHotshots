# Feature Specification: Advanced Stat Viewing System

**Feature Branch**: `001-help-me-create`
**Created**: September 22, 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "We need more advanced stat metrics/viewing. I'd like to have a time series view similar to what DartConnect has for both player and tournament views. It should also show the head to head line up. I want average and median score toggles. Some examples are attached. I want to make sure it fits with the existing UI and _again_ we keep the extra metrics"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input 
   � Feature description provided: Advanced stat viewing with time series
2. Extract key concepts from description 
   � Identified: time series views, player stats, tournament stats, head-to-head, score metrics
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ✓ Clarified: Time periods include weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly with weekly default
   ✓ Clarified: Extra metrics include completion rates, checkout percentages, doubles hit rates, tournament-specific stats
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section 
5. Generate Functional Requirements 
6. Identify Key Entities 
7. Run Review Checklist
   � WARN "Spec has uncertainties marked for clarification"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with clarifications needed)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a tournament organizer or player, I want to view comprehensive statistical analysis over time so that I can track performance trends, compare players, and analyze tournament patterns similar to professional dart tracking systems like DartConnect.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I'm viewing a player's profile, **When** I access their stats section, **Then** I should see a time series chart showing their performance over time with toggle options for average and median scores
2. **Given** I'm viewing tournament statistics, **When** I select a tournament, **Then** I should see time series data for that tournament with player performance trends
3. **Given** I want to compare two players, **When** I access head-to-head view, **Then** I should see their historical matchup data and comparative statistics
4. **Given** I'm viewing any stat chart, **When** I toggle between average and median, **Then** the chart should update to display the selected metric type
5. **Given** I'm using the stat viewing system, **When** I navigate through different views, **Then** the interface should maintain consistency with the existing UI design

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a player has insufficient historical data for meaningful time series?
- How does the system handle tournaments with incomplete or missing data?
- What is displayed when there are no head-to-head matches between selected players?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide time series visualization for individual player statistics
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide time series visualization for tournament-level statistics
- **FR-003**: System MUST display head-to-head comparison data between any two players
- **FR-004**: Users MUST be able to toggle between average and median score displays
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain visual consistency with existing UI design patterns
- **FR-006**: System MUST preserve and display all current advanced metrics including game completion rates, checkout percentages, doubles hit rates, and any specialized tournament-specific statistics
- **FR-007**: System MUST support multiple time period granularities including weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly views with default to weekly
- **FR-008**: Time series charts MUST allow interactive features including date range selection, zoom functionality, and ability to filter by specific tournaments
- **FR-009**: Head-to-head view MUST show comprehensive comparison including win/loss ratio, average score differentials, recent form trends, and head-to-head performance in different tournament types
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle data visualization gracefully with minimum 3 data points for time series display and show appropriate messaging for insufficient data scenarios

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Player Statistics**: Historical performance data over time, individual game scores, tournament participation
- **Tournament Statistics**: Aggregate tournament data, player rankings within tournaments, tournament-specific metrics
- **Head-to-Head Records**: Match history between specific players, comparative performance metrics
- **Time Series Data Points**: Date-stamped statistical measurements, aggregated by specified time periods
- **Metric Calculations**: Average and median score computations, trend analysis data
